  <h1>Herring under a Fur Coat</h1>
  <p>My favorite dish from the Russian cuisine is called "Herring under a fur coat". It looks as strange as it sounds but it tastes delicious. It's strange purplish color comes from one of its components - beetroot. Basically it is a salad made with multiple layers of all the ingredients that Russians love in their cold salads - potatoes, carrots, eggs and mayonnaise. But the main ingredient which gives the salad its name is herring. We usually cook it in winter and typically for New Year's dinner.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <p><ul>
  <li>2 Large, fatty herring</li>
  <li>2 Potatoes</li>
  <li>1 Large beetroot</li>
  <li>2 Large carrots</li>
  <li>1 Medium onion</li>
  <li>1 Egg yolk (for decoration)</li>
  <li>Mayonnaise</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>

  Wash and boil the potatoes, beetroots, and carrots with the skin on until tender. Remove the skin and left aside. Remove the herring's skin, bones, slice into tiny pieces of fillets. The thinner and smaller the pieces are, the softer the salad will be (this technique of making all ingredients as small as possible is what makes the salad literally melt in your mouth). Take a large serving plate and evenly spread out the herring on the serving plate. Peel and finely shred the onion (remember: the smaller, the better!) and spread it out on top of the herring. Cover this layer with a generous amount of mayonnaise (ok, so "generous" because Russians love mayo, but you can choose how much you want to put as more mayo is coming shortly :). Grate boiled potatoes and use them to form the next layer. Cover this layer with a generous amount of mayonnaise. Grate boiled carrots and use them to form the next layer. Cover this layer with a generous amount of mayonnaise. Grate boiled carrots and use them to form the next layer. Cover this layer with a generous amount of mayonnaise (I promise it is the last one). On the top of the salad, crumble boiled egg yolk for decoration. Cover with a lid or foil and place the salad in the refrigerator for several hours before serving. Key learning: Russians love mayo</h4>
