  <h1>Ross's Haggis</h1>
  <p>Haggis is very important culturally in Britain, esp. Scotland, as well as tasting delicious! It’s traditionally eaten on Burns night, a celebration of the Scottish poet Rabbie Burns, when the “ode to a haggis” is recited before the meal. Haggis can also be enjoyed breaded or deep fried in a fish and chip like manner.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <p>1 sheep's stomach or ox secum, cleaned and thoroughly, scalded, turned inside out and soaked overnight in cold salted water - heart and lungs of one lamb - 450g/1lb beef or lamb trimmings, fat and lean - 2 onions, finely chopped - 225g/8oz oatmeal - 1 tbsp salt - 1 tsp ground black pepper - 1 tsp ground dried coriander - 1 tsp mace - 1 tsp nutmeg - water, enough to cook the haggis - stock from lungs and trimmings</p>
  <h3>Mode of preparation</h3>
  <h4><div id="image"><img height="30%" width="30%" img src="images/ross.jpg"></div>
  Wash the lungs, heart and liver (if using). Place in large pan of cold water with the meat trimmings and bring to the boil. Cook for about 2 hours. When cooked, strain off the stock and set the stock aside. Mince the lungs, heart and trimmings. Put the minced mixture in a bowl and add the finely chopped onions, oatmeal and seasoning. Mix well and add enough stock to moisten the mixture. It should have a soft crumbly consistency. Spoon the mixture into the sheep's stomach, so it's just over half full. Sew up the stomach with strong thread and prick a couple of times so it doesn't explode while cooking. Put the haggis in a pan of boiling water (enough to cover it) and cook for 3 hours without a lid. Keep adding more water to keep it covered. To serve, cut open the haggis and spoon out the filling. Serve with neeps (mashed swede or turnip) and tatties (mashed potatoes).</h4>
