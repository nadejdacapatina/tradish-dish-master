  <h1>Crema Catalana</h1>
  <p>“Crema Catalana” is a Spanish dessert originally from the region of Catalonia. Following the tradition my grandmother always cooks it on 19th March, Saint Joseph day, when the whole family will gather around the table with the spoons ready to break the sugar crust and enjoy the cinnamon aroma and the soft texture of the custard that hides under it. No doubt, there will be some debate about who gets the pot with the cinnamon branch or the lemon zest in it. The younger ones will even try to eat it as fast as possible, hide the pot and trick grandma into giving them another one. As any traditional dish, there is not an official, universal recipe but a million of versions of it, this is my grandmother’s one. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <p><ul>
  <li>8 Egg yolks</li>
  <li>1 Liter whole milk</li>
  <li>2 Tablespoons of cornstarch</li>
  <li>10 Tablespoons of sugar</li>
  <li>1 Cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <h4>Put a pan on the fire and pour the milk, along with lemon zest, the cinnamon and 4 tablespoons of sugar. Bring it to boil and turn the fire off. In a large pot, beat together the egg yolks, 2 tablespoon of sugar and the cornstarch until the ingredients are thoroughly blended. Take a little of milk from the pan and dilute the mixture with it slowly. Add everything into the pan again and at low heat, stirring constantly for approximately five minutes. At this point, it is very important that the mixture does not reach its boiling point. Remove the pan from the heat, pour the Crema Catalana into the serving recipients and keep it in the fridge for at least one hour. Just before serving, add some sugar above the Crema Catalana and burn it to create a sugar crust.</h4>
