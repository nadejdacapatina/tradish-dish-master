  <h1>Tafelspitz</h1>
  <p>Tafelspitz - very traditional and delicious! My nan used to cook it for the family and guests. Especially when it is cold outside and you are sitting in the living room with everyone. It warms you up and it is a very healthy dish with all those vegetables and the dark meat. I would not cook it only for myself, but if you are a big group - I would call it a perfect dish.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <p><ul>
  <li>1.5 lb Beef topside (or other quality boiling beef, such as center cut rump, chuck beef or brisket) beef bones, if desired</li>
  <li>3 Large carrots</li>
  <li>1 Large parsnip</li>
  <li>1 Celery root</li>
  <li>1 Leek cut in half</li>
  <li>1 Large onion with skin</li>
  <li>1 – 2 Bay leaves</li>
  <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <h4>Slice the unpeeled onion in half widthways and fry off the cut surfaces without fat until fairly well browned. Put around 3 litres of water into a large saucepan. Add the root vegetables, leek, halves of onion, bay leaves and peppercorns and bring to the boil. Add the washed beef meat and allow to cook until softened in gently simmering water, which will take around 2 ½ – 3 hours. Meanwhile add more water as required. Season well with salt, but only after a good 2 hours. Once the meat has and softened, remove it from the pan and keep it warm in some of the liquid from the soup. Season the remainder of the soup again with salt to taste, and strain it, if preferred. Serve with semolina dumplings or frittata and freshly chopped chives as a starter. Slice the boiled beef. Serve with roast potatoes, a bread and horseradish mix, green beans in a dill sauce. If the root vegetables are to be served at the same time, cook some of them separately. Approx. 2 ½ – 3 hours
